FDA Medical Device Classification and Regulatory Controls

1. Overview
Medical devices are classified into three classes (I, II, III) based on the level of control necessary to assure safety and effectiveness. The classification determines the regulatory requirements before marketing.

2. Class I Devices - Low Risk
Class I devices present minimal potential for harm to the user and are subject to the least regulatory control.

Examples:
- Elastic bandages
- Examination gloves
- Hand-held surgical instruments

Controls:
- General controls apply to all medical devices
- Most are exempt from premarket notification (510(k))
- Must comply with Quality System Regulation (QSR)

3. Class II Devices - Moderate Risk
Class II devices require special controls in addition to general controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

Examples:
- X-ray machines
- Powered wheelchairs
- Infusion pumps
- Surgical drapes

Controls:
- General controls
- Special controls (may include performance standards, labeling requirements, guidance documents)
- Most require premarket notification (510(k)) clearance

4. Class III Devices - High Risk
Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls.

Examples:
- Heart valves
- Silicone gel breast implants
- Implantable pacemakers

Controls:
- General controls
- Premarket approval (PMA) required
- Clinical data typically required
- Most stringent regulatory oversight

5. De Novo Classification Process
For novel devices without a predicate device, the De Novo process allows classification into Class I or II with appropriate controls.

Requirements:
- Submission must demonstrate safety and effectiveness
- Device cannot be classified through traditional 510(k) process
- FDA establishes special controls for Class II devices

6. 510(k) Premarket Notification
Most Class II devices require 510(k) clearance before marketing:

Key Elements:
- Demonstrate substantial equivalence to predicate device
- Provide comparative information on safety and effectiveness
- Include labeling and performance testing data
- FDA has 90 days to review (may be extended)

7. Premarket Approval (PMA)
Class III devices typically require PMA approval:

Key Elements:
- Comprehensive scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness
- Clinical studies usually required
- Manufacturing information
- Labeling and risk analysis
- FDA review period: 180 days (may be extended)

8. Quality System Regulation (QSR)
All medical device manufacturers must comply with QSR requirements:

Key Requirements:
- Design controls for Class II and III devices
- Document control and management responsibility
- Corrective and preventive action procedures
- Production and process controls

9. Postmarket Requirements
After market authorization, manufacturers must:
- Report adverse events through MedWatch
- Maintain device registration and listing
- Comply with labeling requirements
- Conduct postmarket surveillance studies when required

10. Regulatory Decision Factors
FDA considers several factors in device regulation:
- Intended use and indications for use
- Level of risk to patients and users
- Available scientific evidence
- Benefit-risk profile
- Availability of alternative treatments
