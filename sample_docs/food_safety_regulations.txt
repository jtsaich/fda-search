FDA Food Safety Modernization Act and Current Good Manufacturing Practices

1. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Overview
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in 2011, represents the most sweeping reform of food safety laws in the United States in more than 70 years.

Key Principles:
- Prevention-focused approach rather than response-focused
- Enhanced oversight of imported foods
- Improved partnerships with state and local authorities
- Strengthened FDA enforcement tools

2. Preventive Controls for Human Food
Facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding human food must comply with preventive controls requirements:

Food Safety Plan Requirements:
- Hazard analysis identifying known or reasonably foreseeable hazards
- Preventive controls to minimize or prevent hazards
- Monitoring procedures for preventive controls
- Corrective actions and verification activities
- Record-keeping requirements

Covered Facilities:
- Food facilities required to register with FDA
- Exemptions for certain small businesses and farms
- Different requirements based on facility size and type

3. Produce Safety Rule
Establishes science-based minimum standards for growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce:

Key Requirements:
- Agricultural water quality and testing
- Biological soil amendments (compost, manure)
- Health and hygiene of workers
- Equipment, tools, and buildings sanitation
- Domesticated and wild animals management

Covered Produce:
- Fruits and vegetables typically consumed raw
- Exemptions for produce rarely consumed raw
- On-farm packing and holding activities

4. Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs)
Basic sanitary conditions and practices for food facilities:

Personnel Requirements:
- Health and hygiene standards
- Training in food safety principles
- Supervisor oversight responsibilities
- Exclusion of ill employees

Plant and Grounds:
- Adequate physical facilities
- Proper drainage and waste disposal
- Pest control programs
- Sanitary facilities and accommodations

Equipment and Utensils:
- Sanitary design and construction
- Cleaning and sanitizing procedures
- Proper installation and maintenance
- Contact surface materials requirements

5. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)
HACCP principles applied to specific food categories:

Seven HACCP Principles:
1. Conduct hazard analysis
2. Determine critical control points (CCPs)
3. Establish critical limits
4. Establish monitoring procedures
5. Establish corrective actions
6. Establish verification procedures
7. Establish record-keeping and documentation

Mandatory HACCP:
- Seafood processing
- Juice processing
- Meat and poultry (USDA jurisdiction with FDA oversight)

6. Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP)
Importers must verify that foreign suppliers produce food in compliance with U.S. safety standards:

FSVP Requirements:
- Hazard analysis for each imported food
- Evaluation and approval of foreign suppliers
- Verification activities for supplier compliance
- Corrective actions when problems identified

Verification Activities:
- On-site audits and inspections
- Sampling and testing
- Review of supplier food safety records
- Other appropriate verification measures

7. Intentional Adulteration (Food Defense)
Protection against acts intended to cause wide-scale harm to public health:

Mitigation Strategies Required:
- Vulnerability assessment at each step
- Identification of significant vulnerabilities
- Mitigation strategies for each vulnerability
- Food defense monitoring, corrective actions, and verification

Key Elements:
- Actionable process steps identification
- Focused mitigation strategies
- Food defense monitoring procedures
- Verification and validation activities

8. Traceability and Recordkeeping
Enhanced traceability requirements for high-risk foods:

Traceability Records:
- Maintenance of records for tracing food through supply chain
- Critical tracking events documentation
- Key data elements for each event
- Electronic format preferred

Foods Subject to Enhanced Traceability:
- Foods on FDA's traceability list
- High-risk foods with history of contamination
- Foods frequently associated with foodborne illness outbreaks

9. Laboratory Accreditation
Food testing laboratories must meet accreditation standards:

Accreditation Requirements:
- ISO/IEC 17025 standard compliance
- Recognized accrediting bodies
- Proficiency testing participation
- Method validation and verification

Testing Applications:
- Routine surveillance testing
- For-cause testing investigations
- Import screening and testing
- Outbreak investigations

10. Enforcement and Compliance
Enhanced FDA enforcement authorities:

New Authorities:
- Mandatory recall authority
- Enhanced inspection access
- Administrative detention authority
- Suspension of facility registration

Inspection Frequency:
- High-risk facilities: at least every 3 years
- Other facilities: at least every 5 years
- Foreign facilities: increasing inspection frequency
- Risk-based inspection allocation

Compliance with FSMA regulations ensures a comprehensive, prevention-based approach to food safety that protects public health while supporting a competitive food industry.
